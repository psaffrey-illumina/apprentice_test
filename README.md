# Illumina EIBU Apprentice Test

This git repository contains a test for applicants to the Illumina apprenticeship program, focussed on problem solving for computing-based technical roles. 

## Task

This git repository contains a Python script. To complete the task, you need to provide the output from the script.

## General information about the task

The most obvious way to complete this task is to download the Python script contained within this git repository and execute it. It should produce a single line of output which is the "answer" to this test. An alternative is to try to figure out what the script does and then reproduce the output in another way - this is a less satisfying solution, but is still not "cheating" :)

This task involves interacting with a number of computing technologies including git, Python and the operating system on the computer you are using. Understanding and using technologies like these together is a core skill for a programmer or bioinformatician. You may not have come across all these technologies before or know in detail how to use them - figuring out these new technologies, even if you've never seen them before, is also a core skill for a programmer or bioinformatician. You can search the internet, read online documentation and look around on forums as much as you need - this is what you would be doing if you were trying to figure this out as part of your job. 


## Hints

These hints apply if you're attempting the "obvious" solution - to download and run the script.

- You will need to download the script from the git repository. There are a number of ways to do this, including downloading and unpacking a zip archive, using a git installation on your computer or even downloading just the file.

- You will also need a working Python installation on the computer you're using. Does one exist already? If not, you should be able to download and install one.

- How do you run the script in the test with your Python install? Can you find some instructions online about how to do this?

## Extension (for extra credit)

If you manage to complete the main task in the allocated time, you can move on to this section.

The script contained within the git repository has a hard-coded string that it uses as input. Rewrite the script to take a string from the user instead. You can do this using a command line argument (sys.argv), or via a library like argparse or you can use the Python input() function.
